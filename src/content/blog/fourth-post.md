Ready to move beyond casual play and start winning serious money on apps like Solitaire Cash? While luck plays a role, skill and strategy are what separate the top players from everyone else. By mastering a few key concepts, you can dramatically increase your chances of winning matches and taking home bigger prizes.

Here are five expert strategies to get you started:

### 1. Uncover Hidden Cards First

Your first priority should always be to expose the face-down cards in your tableau (the seven columns). Each new card you reveal gives you more options and information. Before making any other move, scan the board to see if you can free up a down-card.

### 2. Don't Empty a Tableau Pile Prematurely

An empty tableau pile can only be filled by a King. While it might be tempting to clear a space, it can limit your moves if you don't have a King ready to place. It's often better to keep your options open by leaving a card in the pile unless you have a strategic reason to clear it.

### 3. Cycle Through Your Draw Pile Wisely

Don't be afraid to cycle through your draw pile multiple times. The cards you need might be buried. A good strategy is to go through the entire pile once at the beginning of the game just to see what you're working with. This helps you plan several moves ahead.

### 4. Prioritize Foundation Piles (But Not Too Eagerly)

Moving cards to the foundation piles (the four stacks at the top) is the ultimate goal, but moving them too quickly can backfire. A low-numbered card (like a 2 or 3) might be needed later to move other cards around in the tableau. A good rule of thumb is to only move a card to the foundation if you're reasonably sure you won't need it again.

### 5. Play with Speed and Accuracy

Most real-money solitaire apps are timed. The faster you complete the game, the higher your time bonus. Once you're comfortable with the core strategies, practice playing faster. Accuracy is still key—a wrong move can cost you more time than you save. Find a balance between speed and careful planning.
